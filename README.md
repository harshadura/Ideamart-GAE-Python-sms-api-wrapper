  README : Ideamart-GAE-Python-sms-api-wrapper
--------------------------------------

Dialog IdeaMart SMS Api wrapper purely written in Python ready to deploy at Google App Engine. 

I guess now you wont take more than 10mins to write a simple SMS app! ;-)

But theirs an issue when you go live with Dialog. (they are asking for a Whitelist IP of the App hosted server!) 

So I prefer this method for simulation purpose only.
